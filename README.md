# bikesharing
analyzing Citi Bike data released to public

## Overview
Now that we were able to create Tableau story for investors in our Citi Bike program, more work still needs to be done that this bike sharing program will see success in Des Moines. One key stakeholder would like to see a bike trip analysis of our current program to see how viable it really is.

## Results

The following links display our findings within certain filters through the use of Tableau.

### Duration of Trips

[Checkout Times for Users](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hammad.mohammad/viz/CheckoutTimesforUsers_16369455433590/CheckoutTimesforUsers?publish=yes)

The above table shows the checkout times for the users who took part in our bike sharing program. Investors would certainly be interested in this specific analysis as it shows how long a user utilizes the program. Therefore, it can then be used to idenitify other costs such as inventory and maintenance which is another financial aspect investors will look for.

[Checkout Times by Gender](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hammad.mohammad/viz/CheckoutTimesbyGender_16369427857060/CheckoutTimesbyGender?publish=yes)

The analysis based on gender will also allow for us to properly identify how much care should be made for the bikes such as max weight, maintenance and bike features.



## Summary 
Our results shows that subscribers tend to use the bikesharing program more especially male subscribers.
